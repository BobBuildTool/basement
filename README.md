# Basement

These basement project is a collection of useful recipes and classes that can be
used by other projects. Most importantly it provides standard classes
to handle common build systems and other standard tasks. Additionally a
standard sandbox and common GCC toolchains are ready-to-use.

# Prerequisites

* A x86_64 system with the regular development tools installed (gcc, make,
  perl, ...)
* Bleeding edge Bob Build Tool (https://github.com/BobBuildTool/bob)
