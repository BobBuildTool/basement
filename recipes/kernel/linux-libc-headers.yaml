# This is a special recipe to build the linux kernel headers which are used by
# libc and in turn the various compilers. Think twice to make any changes here.
# It will result in the rebuild of all involved toolchains and packages. This
# is probably not what you want unless you made changes to headers that are
# needed by libc itself.
#
# If you have a custom kernel with additional driver headers your recipe should
# instead use kernel::linux-headers directly. It's just honest to have this
# direct kernel dependency until the driver was upstreamed.
