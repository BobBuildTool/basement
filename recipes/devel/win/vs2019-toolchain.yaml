# This is no self-contained toolchain. It is just a sentinel for the installed
# version of the host. The paths are gathered by the vsvars plugin and used by
# the cpackage class. The paths are consumed as weak variables to be
# independent of the actual install location. To let Bob see that the different
# flavours of the toolchain we consume the relevant variables here to taint the
# "target-toolchain" tool accordingly.
