Fix libstdc++ include paths for candian cross builds

In a true canadian cross build, libstdc++ is built with the "target" compiler.
This is a cross compiler and it is therefore harmful to use the build machine
standard include paths. Instead, we can rely on the fact that the C and libc
header files are found naturally by the cross-compiler in its sysroot.
