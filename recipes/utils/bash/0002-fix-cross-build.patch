Subject: [PATCH] Fix cross build

Bash has CFLAGS and CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD. CFLAGS are used for (cross)compiling
bash, while CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD are used with the host-gcc. Therefore, the
CROSS_COMPILE information needs to be at CFLAGS instead of CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD.
Otherwise, the wrong settings detected by configure are picked up.
